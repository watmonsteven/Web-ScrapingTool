Legal and Ethical Considerations

    This tool should only be used on websites that permit scraping

    Always check the website's robots.txt file and terms of service

    Respect rate limits and don't overload servers

    Consider adding explicit permission checks in future versions

Installation Requirements
text

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Usage Example

    Run the script

    Enter a URL when prompted (e.g., "https://example.com")

    Specify save location or press Enter for default

    Specify filename or press Enter for default

    The HTML content will be saved to the specified location

Limitations

    Cannot bypass advanced anti-bot systems

    Doesn't execute JavaScript (dynamic content won't be captured)

    Limited error recovery for complex websites

This program provides a solid foundation that can be expanded with more sophisticated features as needed.
